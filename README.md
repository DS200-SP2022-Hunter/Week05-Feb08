# Lab Assignment 05, Due on [Canvas](https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2174978), Feb. 16 at 11:59pm
## Creating interactive maps using folium

The main objective of today's lab is to reproduce the output and maps of [Section 8.5](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/08/5/Bike_Sharing_in_the_Bay_Area.html) in the textbook, with some modifications.  The original code in that section does not work (at least it does not work in the Google Colab environment), so you'll need to modify the code to make it work.  Along the way, you'll learn how to join tables, an extremely important data-handling skill.

Most of the code you should need is in [Section 8.5 of the textbook](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/08/5/Bike_Sharing_in_the_Bay_Area.html).  When you turn in your work, it should not contain any irrelevant text and code boxes; therefore, if you use the textbook as the basis for your work, please delete text and code boxes unrelated to the assignment before you turn in your lab.

This assignment uses the 'join' method extensively, which is the topic of [Section 8.4](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/08/4/Joining_Tables_by_Columns.html).  I recommend that you work through Section 8.4 and make sure you understand its logic before moving on to the tasks below.

**Objective**:  Produce a map of the Bay Area in which the number of bike rentals starting at each station is represented by a colored circle whose area is proportional to the number of rentals and whose color represents the city where the station is located.  The map will look almost like the final map in Section 8.5 except with colors chosen as in the five-color map earlier in the section.
